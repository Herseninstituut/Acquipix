%
%This toolbox contains two components: acquisition scripts for running
%experiments as well as pre-processing scripts to transform your
%experimental data into useable clustered data:
%
%% i) Data acquisition during experiments
%You can use the EyeTracking toolbox to record the mouse's eyetracking, and
%experiment scripts such as RunDriftingGratings.m
%
%To start an experiment, type: RunExperiment
%
%% ii) Data pre-processing
%After data acquisition, you can pre-process your data using the GUI
%
%To start the pre-processor, type: runRecordingProcessor
%
